# Surf's Up: A Climate Analysis of Hawaii

## Overview
In hopes of opening a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii, we will analyze the weather trends to assess the sustainabiliy of the endevor. 

Using weather data obtained from verious weather stations we will use Jupyter Notebook to analyze temperatures for the months of June and December with data spanning the time range between 2010 to 2017.

## Results:
After pulling the daily temperatures for June and December, summary statistics tables were created as seen below:

Temperatures were then converted to Celcius for ease of analysis:

Calculations were based on 1700 recordings for June and 1517 recordings for December

From the tables above we can see the following:

The max temperature recorded is: 
- 29.44°C (85°F) for June
- 28.33°C (83°F) for December

The min temperatur0e recorded is:
- 17.78°C (64°F) for June
- 13.33°C (69°F) for December

The average temperatures are:

## Summary:
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
